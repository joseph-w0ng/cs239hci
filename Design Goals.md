Many users are becoming aware of web cookies but lack a clear understanding of their function and implications. According to our user research, about half of internet users recognize the existence of cookies. Their knowledge of cookies, however, is often superficial, making it difficult for the users to distinguish between essential cookies that enhance functionality and those that pose privacy risks.

In addition, most websites are regulated to ask for cookie permission, but the cookie consent requests are often vague and manipulative, leaving users with only options such as accepting all or rejecting. 

This presents an issue that: users want a convenient and secure browsing experience but are frequently interrupted by cookie consent requests that they do not fully comprehend or engage with. The users often feel gaslighted with those manipulative cookie consents while being unaware of what kind of cookies they have shared with the websites. 

[+1] Create a paper prototype. Take + upload pictures or a video of your paper prototype.\

[+1] Articulate your design goals as you start to implement a high-fidelity prototype of your interactive system.

[+1] Provide a plan for implementation. Create a timeline, find sync points, assign tasks. Suggestion: Work backwards from the March 4 pilot deadline.

Feb 24: Finalize design; parallel prototyping and asking users for feedback. Decide on a design to prototype.\
Mar 1: Have a working prototype ready.\
Mar 3: Finish basic testing, make sure there are no obvious bugs.\
