[+0.5] Update your problem statement.\
Many users are becoming aware of web cookies but lack a clear understanding of their function and implications. According to our user research, about half of internet users recognize the existence of cookies and do not want their personal data being collected. Their knowledge of cookies, however, is often superficial, making it difficult for the users to distinguish between essential cookies that enhance functionality and those that pose privacy risks. Due to regulations, many websites are forced to ask for cookie consent through vague and manipulative popups.

Users want a convenient and secure browsing experience but are frequently interrupted by cookie consent popups that they do not fully comprehend. Due to their intrusive nature, users often make uninformed choices about the data they choose to share with websites while maintaining a seamless browsing experience. 

[+1] Create a paper prototype. Take + upload pictures or a video of your paper prototype.\
[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kGQS7KU01GcNaxs7sVkj7t/CS-239-Figma-Wireframe?node-id=107-768&t=X1BBUhslb7RLZC3o-1&show-proto-sidebar=1&starting-point-node-id=107%3A768)

[+0.5] Summarize 1-3 takeaways from the feedback you received in class.\
- Make purpose of buttons clear. Make sure the buttons to activate / de-activate certain cookies is labeled.
- Maybe provide statistics on how many users enable / disable a certain cookie
- Maybe add presets so that certain types of cookies are disabled by default, and allow opt-in for other cookies
  
[+1] Articulate your design goals as you start to implement a high-fidelity prototype of your interactive system.

- Design goal 1:
  - What is the goal? Simple, easy to understand visualization of active cookies which are collecting a user's data on a given site.
  - Why is this important? Through giving and receiving feedback with paper prototypes / Figma wireframes as well as interviews, users expressed that they do not want to read a lot of text, and that they will only look at brief snippets in order to manage their cookie preferences.
  - How will you design for this goal? Provide short summaries of cookie data being collected, eliminate technical jargon, color code cookies by their function (functional, session, performance, tracking, etc.)
 
- Design goal 2:
  - What is the goal? Easy way to customize default cookie preferences for all sites, with option to override default settings.
  - Why is this important? Follow-up interviews (and our survey) revealed that users strongly dislike cookie popups, and want to be able to set cookie preferences by default for all sites in one tool. However, users also wanted the ability to customize the cookies they allow on different sites.
  - How will you design for this goal? Provide default settings which apply to all sites, but also allow users to allow additional cookies on certain sites and save the user's preferences.


[+1] Provide a plan for implementation. Create a timeline, find sync points, assign tasks. Suggestion: Work backwards from the March 4 pilot deadline.

Feb 24: Finalize design; parallel prototyping and asking users for feedback. Decide on a design to prototype.\
Mar 1: Have a working prototype ready.\
Mar 3: Finish basic testing, make sure there are no obvious bugs.

What did each member contribute to this phase of the project?
Joseph: Built the Figma prototype, contributed with design goals
Beide: Updated the problem statement, made changes to the Figma prototype, helped with design goals

Did you use a generative AI tool? If so, which and how?
No
